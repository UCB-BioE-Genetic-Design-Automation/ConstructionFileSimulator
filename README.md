# ConstructionFileSimulator

This is code from 20n project C4, minimally altered to enable extraction from the larger codebase.  The direct copy-over is in the first committ.  The original code was not complete and had many errors.  It was also not in rebuild-the-world style of Functions and Models
It also has no tests.

2019_03_23
The code has been reworked, and is now functional on all examples considered, which is complete (until we find out it's not).

Models:

Polynucleotide:  This is an immutable Model encoding the structure of a nucleic acid molecule. It is needed to simulate the enzymatic reactions occuring during digestion and ligation. The complex it describes can be DNA or RNA (not used here), single stranded or double stranded, have sticky ends on either side, or can be circular. It contains a toString() method that gives a visual representation of the molecule showing the duplex with its ends:

A linear DNA with BamHI sticky ends on both sides:

<pre>
5'-GATCCtttG    -3'
3'-    GaaaCCTAG-5'
</pre>

There are convenience Constructors for instantiating blunt-ended, linear fragments, and circular fragments.  The above digest would be described as follows:

<pre>
Polynucleotide poly = new Polynucleotide("CtttG", "GATC", "GATC");
</pre>

The first argument, the "sequence" corresponds to the region of duplexed DNA. The second two strings are the 5' and 3' sticky ends.  If "" it is a blunt end.  All sticky ends are represented in the 5' to 3' direction referring to the top strand.  Thus both arguments here are "GATC".  A 3' extension is represented by the symbol "-" such as:

<pre>
Polynucleotide poly = new Polynucleotide("gaaacccGAGGAGaaaaaaaa", "-TGCA", "-CC");

5'-    gaaacccGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCC-3'
3'-ACGTctttgggCTCCTCtttttttt  -5'
</pre>

A circular DNA is indicated by a boolean, and the sticky end fields are ignored in algorithms:  The toString() method illustrates
circularity with "..." symbols

<pre>
Polynucleotide poly = new Polynucleotide("aaaaaaaa", true);

5'...aaaaaaaa...3'
3'...tttttttt...5'
</pre>

*******
Functions:
*******

All Functions contain initiate and run methods, and follow rebuild-the-world conventions. To invoke one, you instantiate and initiate the Function once, and then use this instance for many calls of run. For example:

<pre>
ExampleFunction func = new ExampleFunction();
func.initiate();
for(ini i=0; i<1000000; i++) {
    func.run(...);
}
</pre>

The Functions below are in the org.ucb.c5.construction package.  Initialize them as with ExampleFunction above, then run them with examples provided.  More examples are present in each class's main method.

PolyRevComp: Reverse complement Function for a Polynucleotide.  Inputs a Polynucleotide and returns a new Polynucleotide.

<pre>
Demo a PstI/BseRI digested DNA with 3' overhangs

Polynucleotide poly = new Polynucleotide("gaaacccGAGGAGaaaaaaaa", "-TGCA", "-CC");
Polynucleotide rc = func.run(poly);
            
5'-    gaaacccGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCC-3'
3'-ACGTctttgggCTCCTCtttttttt  -5'

5'-  ttttttttCTCCTCgggtttcTGCA-3'
3'-CCaaaaaaaaGAGGAGcccaaag    -5'
</pre>

Digest:  Simulates digestion to completion.  Inputs a single Polynucleotide and a List of restriction enzymes, and returns a list of Polynucleotides representing the full digestion products by all the enzymes.  The enzymes are provided as objects encoding cutting details.  They are generated by another Function, RestrictionEnzymeFactory.  Circular DNAs will be linearized. The runnable demo below is from demo package class DemoDigAndLig illustrating digestion of a circular DNA and then re-ligation of the products.

<pre>
Demo digestion of a circular DNA with BamHI and BseRI

//Initialize the functions
RestrictionEnzymeFactory factory = new RestrictionEnzymeFactory();
factory.initiate();
Digest dig = new Digest();
dig.initiate();

//Construct the polynucleotide and restriction enzymes
Polynucleotide poly = new Polynucleotide("atatatatGGATCCacacacacacGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCCagagagagag", true);
List enz = new ArrayList<>();
enz.add(factory.run(Enzyme.BseRI));
enz.add(factory.run(Enzyme.BamHI));
    
//Run the Digest Function
List<Polynucleotide> digfrags = dig.run(poly, enz);

Starting plasmid:
5'...atatatatGGATCCacacacacacGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCCagagagagag...3'
3'...tatatataCCTAGGtgtgtgtgtgCTCCTCttttttttGGtctctctctc...5'

Digestion fragments:
5'-  agagagagagatatatatG    -3'
3'-GGtctctctctctatatataCCTAG-5'

5'-GATCCacacacacacGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCC-3'
3'-    GtgtgtgtgtgCTCCTCtttttttt  -5'
</pre>

Ligate:  Simulates ligation to completion.  Inputs a List of Polynucleotide representing the DNA fragments, and returns a single Polynucleotide.  It will throw an Exception if the sequences do not assemble into a single product.  It will also circularize a DNA able to do so.  DemoDigAndLig continued:

<pre>
Ligate lig = new Ligate();
lig.initiate();
Polynucleotide pdt = lig.run(digfrags);

Religated product:
5'...agagagagagatatatatGGATCCacacacacacGAGGAGaaaaaaaaCC...3'
3'...tctctctctctatatataCCTAGGtgtgtgtgtgCTCCTCttttttttGG...5'
</pre>
